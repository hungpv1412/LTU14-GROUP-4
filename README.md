# Important Notes : 
- Create a database(MySQL) and create the "Users" table using "DBScript" file.
- Change the "dbSettings/settings.properties" file as to your database configurations for the server.
  (PublicChatServer>dbSettings)
- Use the registry-port as 5050 (Recommended) or change the source code accourdingly in Server's Main class (ServerMain).

# Executing 
*** Take note that the current implementation requires you to run the artifacts (jar files) instead of running the "main" classes 
using the IDE (To avoid "FileNotFound execeptions for resources") -> Otherwise change the source code accordingly*** 

# IDE - IntelliJ IDEA
